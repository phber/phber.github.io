  title={The Sounds of the Planets (Data Sonification)},
  abstract={A data sonification project where I both sonify and visualize planet orbit data. The pitches of the planets mirror the scales conceived by Johannes Kepler in his book "Harmonices Mundi". If you are interested in the details of the project, go ahead visit the page "curiosities" where I have provided an overview of the project.},
