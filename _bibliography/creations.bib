  abstract={A data sonification project where I both sonify and visualize planet orbit data. The pitches of the planets mirror the scales conceived by Johannes Kepler in his book "Harmonices Mundi". If you are interested in the details of the project, go ahead visit my blog where I have compiled a post detailing the project.},
