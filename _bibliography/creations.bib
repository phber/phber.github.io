  title={The Sounds of the Planets (Data Sonification)},
  abstract={A data sonification project where I both visualize planet orbit data and turn it into sound. The pitches of the planets mirror the scales conceived by Johannes Kepler in his book "Harmonices Mundi". If you are interested in details of the project, go ahead and read my <a href="/curiosities/planet-sonification/">deep dive</a>.},
