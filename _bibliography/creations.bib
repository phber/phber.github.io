  title={The Sounds of the Planets (Data Sonification)},
  abstract={A data sonification project where I both visualize planet orbit data and turn it into sound. The pitches of the planets mirror the scales conceived by Johannes Kepler in his book "Harmonices Mundi". If you are interested in the details, go ahead visit the page "curiosities" where I have provided an overview of the project.},
