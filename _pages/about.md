<hr />
My name is Philip Bergstr√∂m and I am a Musician and Engineer from Sweden. My main instrument is the violin and I am currently studying at the Academy for Music and Drama in Gothenburg. Before that, I studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, earning a M.Sc. in Engineering Physics with a specialization in Machine Learning.
