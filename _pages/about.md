My name is Philip Bergstr√∂m and I am a Musician and Engineer from Sweden. My main instrument is the violin and I am currently studying at the [Academy of Music and Drama](https://www.gu.se/en/music-drama) in Gothenburg. Before that, I studied at the [Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm, earning a M.Sc. in Engineering Physics with a specialization in Machine Learning.
