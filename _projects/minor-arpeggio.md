## Applying the Trick

I was recently introduced to a "trick" by a teacher at my university, known as the "minor arpeggio secret" or "minor arpeggio trick" (named so by the bassist [Chris West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umdwB1m70es)). It can be summarized as following (from Wikipedia):

>If we can maintain the same tension while plucking twice, 3 times, 4 times that length, etc. the undertone series will unfold downwards, containing the minor triad. Similarly, on a wind instrument, if the holes are equally spaced, each successive hole covered will produce the next note in the undertone series.

For string players, this means that you are able to play a perfect (justly intonated) minor
arpeggio if you move your hand position in equal distances without changing the distance between your fingers.

## Why it works

There are several ways of explaining why the minor arpeggio secret works, but fundamentally it is a consequence of the shape of the overtone series and its antipode, the undertone series. While the overtone series arises when dividing the string into integer divions, the undertone series unfolds by doing the opposite, i.e. multiplying the string length by integers.

As you can see in the image below, the fundamentals 1-6 of the undertone series contain a perfect minor arpeggio from F:

When we are going up the fingerboard, we are shortening (rather than lengthening) the string which means that we will play the notes of the undertone series going backwards. For example, if we imagine a string which produces the tone F3 and divide it into 6 equal parts we will play the following notes:

| Length ratio | Interval | Pitch |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| 1:6          | 6:1      | C6    |
| 2:6          | 3:1      | C5    |
| 3:6          | 2:1      | F4    |
| 4:6          | 3:2      | C4    |
| 5:6          | 6:5      | Ab3   |
| 6:6          | 1:1      | F3    |
