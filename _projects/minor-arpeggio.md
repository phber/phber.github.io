## Applying the Trick

I was recently introduced to a neat concept by a teacher at my university, known as the "minor arpeggio trick" (or "minor arpeggio secret" by the bassist [Chris West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umdwB1m70es)). It can be summarized as following (from Wikipedia):

>If we can maintain the same tension while plucking twice, 3 times, 4 times that length, etc. the undertone series will unfold downwards, containing the minor triad. Similarly, on a wind instrument, if the holes are equally spaced, each successive hole covered will produce the next note in the undertone series.

For string players, this means that you are able to play a perfect (justly intonated) minor
arpeggio by moving your hand position in equal distances without changing the distance between your fingers. This becomes especially useful for double bassists since they often have to perform shifts with a constant hand frame.

## Why it works

There are several ways of explaining why the minor arpeggio secret works, but fundamentally it is a consequence of the overtone series and its antipode, the undertone series. While the overtone series arises when dividing the string into integer divions, the undertone series unfolds by doing the opposite, i.e. multiplying the string length by integers.

As an example, the fundamentals 1-6 of the undertone series of C form the shape of a pure minor arpeggio from F:

When we are going up the fingerboard, we are shortening (rather than lengthening) the string which means that we will play the notes of the undertone series going backwards. For example, if we imagine a string which produces the tone F3 and divide it into 6 equal parts we will play the following notes:

| Length ratio | Interval | Pitch |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| 1:6          | 6:1      | C6    |
| 2:6          | 3:1      | C5    |
| 3:6          | 2:1      | F4    |
| 4:6          | 3:2      | C4    |
| 5:6          | 6:5      | Ab3   |
| 6:6          | 1:1      | F3    |
