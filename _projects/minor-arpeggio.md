## Applying the Trick

I was recently introduced to a neat concept by a teacher at my university, known as the "minor arpeggio trick" (or "minor arpeggio secret" by the bassist [Chris West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umdwB1m70es)). It can be summarized as following (from Wikipedia):

>If we can maintain the same tension while plucking twice, 3 times, 4 times that length, etc. the undertone series will unfold downwards, containing the minor triad. Similarly, on a wind instrument, if the holes are equally spaced, each successive hole covered will produce the next note in the undertone series.

For string players, this means that you are able to play a perfect (justly intonated) minor
arpeggio by moving your hand position in equal distances on one string without changing the distance between your fingers. For example, assume you are playing a E with your first finger followed by a G with your third finger on the same string (a minor third). If you then shift up to the G with your first finger, your third finger will land on a B if you kept the distance between your first and third finger unchanged (a major third). Similarly, if you shift your first finger from the G to the B, your third finger will land on an E an octave higher than your starting note (a perfect fourth). 

This "trick" will work regardless of your starting note or position, and becomes especially useful for double bassists since they often have to perform shifts with a constant hand frame. It is also useful to determine whether you need to increase or change the distance between your fingers when shifting up and down a string to play other intervals.

## Why it works

There are several ways of explaining why the minor arpeggio secret works, but fundamentally it is a consequence of the overtone series and its antipode, the undertone series. While the overtone series arises when dividing the string into integer divions, the undertone series unfolds by doing the opposite, i.e. multiplying the string length by integers. In other words, we will play notes from the undertone series if we shorten or lengthen the string by equal distance intervals.

As an example, the fundamentals 1-6 of the undertone series of C form the shape of a pure minor arpeggio from F:

When we are going up the fingerboard, we are shortening (rather than lengthening) the string which means that we will play the notes of the undertone series going backwards. For example, if we imagine a string which produces the tone F3 and divide it into 6 equal parts we will generate the following notes and intervals:

| Length ratio | Interval | Pitch |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| 1:6          | 6:1      | C6    |
| 2:6          | 3:1      | C5    |
| 3:6          | 2:1      | F4    |
| 4:6          | 3:2      | C4    |
| 5:6          | 6:5      | Ab3   |
| 6:6          | 1:1      | F3    |

Consequently, we are playing notes from the undertone series on C when we are using the minor arpeggio trick to play an F-minor arpeggio on one string.
